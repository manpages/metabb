In order to get development environment just run env.sh as root
Then do 
	$ chgrp -R <group> .
	$ chown -R <user> .
And edit yaws.conf and erl.sh

To get it finally working run erl.sh and do
	> application:start(yaws).
	> application:start(fission).

If it is the first run, also do
	> fission:initialize(node()).
